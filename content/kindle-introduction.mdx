Hello 💗

Actually, I prepared this Kindle introduction article for my niece İlayda. My aim was to help her get an easy start with Kindle. Later, when I wanted to share it with my friend Mesut, I decided to transfer the article to the blog as it is. I tried to share briefly what I know about Kindle here. You can write your questions as comments. This article will be updated over time.

🦶 **First step**

First step: You need to create a new account on [amazon.com](http://amazom.com), then you can link the Kindle you have to the account you created with email and password.

💻 **Calibre**

To upload books in PDF or MOBI format, there's an e-book editing application called [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/download). I recommend using this. You can download it to your computer and explore the application. You can connect the Kindle to the computer via cable, then open Calibre and see, delete, or add books inside the Kindle. You can also use it to organize your book archive. You can change the book cover image, etc.

💯 **Buying books**

There's no direct book sale for Kindle in Turkey yet. So book sales are only available through [amazon.com](http://amazon.com). The number of Turkish books is very, very low. But there's no limit on English books.

🦙 **Free Amazon books**

When you link your Kindle to your account, [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com) will give you the right to get a few books for free. You can later use this right to purchase English books you want to read. I recommend looking at simple children's books for English practice.

🙀 **So where are the Turkish books?**

You can find Turkish e-books on many websites on the internet. But the largest Turkish book sources I'�v�e seen are in book groups on the Telegram application. It literally quenched our thirst for Turkish books in Germany. I'm putting two sample book groups below. It's like there's no book you can't find in these groups. If it's not enough, you can find more groups with a quick search on Google.

📘 **I also want to read books that have print versions**

If you can't find the digital version of a book and want to read it on Kindle, you can buy the original book, then go to a photocopy shop to have it scanned, get the scanned images, convert them to text with an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) program, and convert it to EPUB format. A program called **FineReader** converts the text on paper to text. It seems to do it the most properly. Then you can convert this EPUB format to MOBI in the Calibre application, and then upload it to Kindle.

📩 **Send files to mail, read immediately from Kindle**

By the way, there may be situations where you can't use the Calibre application but want to transfer MOBI, or PDF, TXT, DOC. In that case, you'll have a free email address assigned to you on [amazon.com](http://amazon.com). You can email the file you want to read there. It will arrive on your Kindle within a few minutes. You'll find that address under "Your Devices And Content" on Amazon. There are screenshots below.

Where is the email address assigned to you under [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com)? Here it is 🙂

💬 **Final words**

Don't worry, over time, using this device will become even easier, and as a result, you'll double, triple, or even quadruple the number of books you read.
