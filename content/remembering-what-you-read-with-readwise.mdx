For years, I struggled with a persistent problem. I'd look at my bookshelf and wonder, "Did I read this book?" I'd pick it up, see my own highlights, and think, "Oh, I did read it. But what were the important parts for me?" Often, the answer was... nothing. Maybe the book wasn't that important after all.

This question haunted me for a long time: If I can't remember the books I read, why am I reading them at all?

<Callout label="The Forgetting Curve" variant="info">

The struggle with forgetting what we read is a common one, rooted in cognitive science. Hermann Ebbinghaus, a German psychologist, discovered the "forgetting curve" in the late 19th century. This curve shows how information is lost over time when there's no attempt to actively recall it.

For example:
- After 20 minutes, you may have forgotten 42% of what you learned
- After 1 day, 67% may be gone
- After 31 days, you may retain only 21% of the original information

This is why active recall and spaced repetition are so crucial for retaining information from books and other sources.

During conversations, I couldn't reference quotes that came to mind. When writing, no relevant ideas from my reading surfaced, or if they did, I couldn't properly cite them. Most of the time, I couldn't even remember the content of the book, as if I'd completely forgotten it. It was frustrating, to say the least.

## The Journey Begins: Analog Note-Taking

Then an idea struck me. To remember the parts I highlighted in books, I decided to write them down in a small notebook. Yes, I would carry this notebook with me, and when someone said, "That's not how it works," I could quickly check my notes and say, "Actually, it's like this. Let me look it up... Yes, here it is!"

And it worked. I truly saw the benefit of note-taking when I started doing it consistently.

<Callout label="The Power of Handwritten Notes" variant="info">

Research has shown that handwriting notes can be more effective for learning than typing. A study published in Psychological Science found that students who took longhand notes performed better on conceptual questions than those who took notes on laptops.

Here are a few reasons why:
1. Deeper processing: Writing by hand requires you to rephrase information in your own words, leading to better understanding.
2. Slower pace: Handwriting is slower, forcing you to be more selective about what you write, which improves focus and comprehension.
3. Lack of distractions: Unlike with digital devices, there's no temptation to multitask when writing by hand.

## Enter Anki: Digital Spaced Repetition

Years later, I discovered Anki, a spaced repetition system (SRS). I wondered if I could commit my favorite parts of books to memory. It seemed like a wild idea, but I was excited to try.

I added my book notes to Anki as flashcards. Now, as part of my daily routine, I could review my book notes and reference them more frequently in conversations. I even started including authors' names in my references, which was a big deal for someone like me who struggles to remember names.

<Callout label="The Science of Spaced Repetition" variant="info">

Spaced repetition is a learning technique that leverages the psychological spacing effect. By reviewing information at gradually increasing intervals, you can significantly improve long-term retention.

Here's how it typically works:
1. First review: Right after learning
2. Second review: 1 day later
3. Third review: 3 days later
4. Fourth review: 1 week later
5. Fifth review: 2 weeks later

And so on, with the intervals growing based on how well you remember the information. This method has been shown to increase retention by up to 50% compared to mass studying.

## The Digital Dilemma

As time went on, I found myself bouncing between Kindle, physical books, and various note-taking methods. I lost track of what I had highlighted where. I'd mark something in Kindle but forget to add it to Anki, or add something to Anki that wasn't highlighted in my Kindle. Were the quotes in my paper notes added to Anki?

## Readwise: The Game-Changer

Finally, I discovered that someone (or rather, a team) who had faced the same struggles had turned this into a proper project. Readwise emerged as an application that could import from various sources, export in different formats, and bring together highlights from multiple platforms.

I had actually tried Readwise before, but at that time, it just randomly emailed results. There wasn't a scientific method like SRS behind it. In April 2022, I attended a PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) conference where the founder of Readwise discussed the latest updates to the application.

<Callout label="The Rise of PKM Tools" variant="info">

Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) tools have gained significant popularity in recent years. These digital solutions help individuals collect, organize, and synthesize information from various sources.

Some popular PKM tools include:
1. Roam Research: A note-taking tool for networked thought
2. Obsidian: A powerful, local-first alternative to Roam
3. Notion: An all-in-one workspace for notes, databases, and more
4. Readwise: Specifically focused on managing highlights and notes from various reading sources

The key advantage of these tools is their ability to create connections between disparate pieces of information, mimicking the way our brains naturally link ideas.

I decided to give it another try. I added a few books, and I was impressed. The app, the email digests, the website â€“ everything was well-designed. It had become a complete information management center with a clean, user-friendly interface.

As I explored further, I realized it could be beneficial not just for me, but for others too. People could subscribe to the highlight lists I created. While reviewing my favorite parts from my favorite books to send them a weekly newsletter, I started sharing the most valuable insights I had marked as favorites.

If anyone's interested, they can subscribe to the things I read here: https://readwise.io/@mustafasarac (It comes as a weekly newsletter, nothing else.)

<Callout label="The Value of Shared Knowledge" variant="info">

Sharing knowledge has been shown to have numerous benefits, both for the sharer and the recipient:

1. Reinforced learning: Teaching or sharing information helps solidify your own understanding.
2. Network building: Sharing knowledge can help you connect with like-minded individuals and build a community.
3. Collective intelligence: When people share knowledge, it contributes to the overall knowledge base of a group or society.

A study published in the Journal of Applied Psychology found that teams who shared unique knowledge outperformed those who didn't, highlighting the importance of knowledge sharing in collaborative environments.

There's nothing more satisfying than knowing that things that have been helpful to me can be helpful to others as well. By leveraging tools like Readwise and embracing the practice of active reading and note-taking, we can not only enhance our own learning but also contribute to the growth and knowledge of others.

Remember, the goal isn't just to read more, but to remember and apply more of what we read. Happy reading, and even happier remembering!
