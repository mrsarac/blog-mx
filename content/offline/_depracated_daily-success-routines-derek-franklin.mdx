[A Daily Success Routine: Transform Your Life 1 Day At A Time - Derek Franklin](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/A-Daily-Success-Routine-Transform-Your-Life-1-Day-At-A-Time/358452675/)

## Introduction
My notes from Derek Franklin's "A Daily Success Routine: Transform Your Life 1 Day At A Time" course, which I discovered on the Skillshare platform. These are valuable steps that we can apply in our daily lives to increase our personal productivity. I know that these routines can be important for my self-improvement and leading a more efficient life. Therefore, I wanted to create a guide for myself and share the fundamental concepts and practices I learned in the course to be helpful to others.

### Daily Success Routine. Transform Your Life Every Day.

## Express Out Loud
- Whenever you speak your positive ideas, beliefs, feelings, what you are thinking of creating, and what you will do, the problematic monster inside you will shrink.

- “Speech is the mirror of the soul; as a man speaks, so he is.” – [[publilius syrus]]
- Another benefit is that it makes you more charismatic.
- ⭐ By practicing this, you can improve every area of your life. There is no limit.
	- Your communication skills.
	- Your ability to finish tasks.
	- Your ability to start a new habit.
	- Your learning capacity.
	- Your mastery of any subject.
	- Overcoming your fears.

## Freestyle Expression
- Stand in front of a camera, look at the camera, and speak.
- ⭐ Goals, dreams, recent experiences, fears, what I learned, ideas, memories, to-dos, recap of yesterday, other things in the flow.
- Set a timer for 5-10 minutes, stick to it.
- Express your emotions, feelings, and what's in your heart.
- Don't go back, just move forward (just like when you are writing).
- Even if nothing comes out, keep talking without stopping.

## Gratitude (20 Things) 1-3 minutes
- The more you focus on good thoughts, the more good thoughts will come.
- One of the best methods is to cover 20 things you love.
	- I love smelling morning coffee.
	- I love doing things that will change people's lives.
	- I love watching outside the window.
	- Things you love...
- When you express this by talking to yourself, you can convey these feelings to yourself better and more easily.
- ⭐ Expressing it by talking is a much more effective method than writing.

## I Am...
- **As you define yourself, your identity will adapt to this definition.**
- I am healthier and more energetic, I love running every day.
- Define this separately for each of the 7 days of the week and repeat them every day.

## Positive and Strong Beliefs
- Some beliefs hold you back, some push you forward.
- ⭐ Our beliefs come from our family, environment, and what we watch.

## Teach to Learn
- The best method to learn is to teach.
- Speak out loud for 1-3 minutes about the last thing you learned.
- ⭐ "I want to talk for a few minutes to clarify the new topic I learned."
- Choose a topic and explain it with your emotions.
	- **What?** What is it?
	- **Why?** Explain why it is important.
	- **How?** Explain how you can use it? How can you apply it to your life?
- Do this whenever you have the opportunity.

## Idea Generation Machine
- It helps develop your idea muscles.
- If you generate 10 ideas a day, you will have 3650 ideas in a year.
- ⭐ It can be about any topic.
	- Video suggestions
	- The top 10 things in my life
	- 10 things I do poorly
	- 10 things I can do to improve them
	- 10 unnecessary things I spend my time on
	- 10 valuable lessons I have learned in my life
	- 10 healthy foods that make me feel good
	- 10 foods I should avoid
	- 10 habits I should avoid
	- 10 solutions to improve this topic,
	- 10 skills I can learn to make money
- Allocate time for this and make sure to produce.
- Every idea should pass through the mind but come from the heart.
- Always try to generate new ideas.
